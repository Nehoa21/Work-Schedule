# Work-Schedule

This project is a personal schedule of a work day, between the hours of 9AM and 5PM. Tasks can be entered into each hour of the day and saved into the local storage until deleted. Day.JS is used to give the exact day and time the moment the page is opened/refreshed. Each time block is color coded depending on the time of the work day, whether it's past, present, or future.
